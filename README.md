# Digit Recognizer Competition from Kaggle
 
 Here I used a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on the provided dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). I built it with Keras from Tensorflow which is very intuitive. 
 
 
 ## First
 I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.

I achieved 99.4% of accuracy with this CNN trained in 15 min on a M1 Macbook Air.
